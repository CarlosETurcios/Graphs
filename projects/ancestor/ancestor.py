# how can I use a graph to solve this?
# get the earliest know Ancestor
# how is childer connected to the parent
# Graph termanlogy
# - what are my nodes? = the interger
# - what are my edges? = when is there an edge when is a node connected to another node ? when not ?
# Build your graph , or wright you get Neighbors
# Choose how will you traverse the graph ?
# how do we know what is connected to what ?
# DFS
