# understanding the problem
# how can I use a graph to solve this?
# get the earliest know Ancestor
# how is childer connected to the parent
# Graph termanlogy
# - what are my nodes? = the interger
# - what are my edges? = when is there an edge when is a node connected to another node ? when not ?
# Build your graph , or wright you get Neighbors
# Choose how will you traverse the graph ?
# how do we know what is connected to what ?
# DFS

    #  returns their earliest known ancestor â€“ the one at the farthest distance from the input individual.
    # If there is more than one ancestor tied for "earliest", return the one with the lowest numeric ID.
    #  If the input individual has no parents, the function should return -1.
